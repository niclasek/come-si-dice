# come-si-dice
A Node.JS Angular MongoDB application for learning Italian

# Aim
To do an SPA that uses Angular as front end with Node.js on the backend that exposes a RESTful layer that the front end consumes. The backend should have an architecture with different layers: rest api layer, service layer and database layer. The aim is to use good objected oriented practicies as interfaces and design patterns.
